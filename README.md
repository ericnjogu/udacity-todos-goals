# Udacity TODOs and Goals
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) then code from a single page follow along project was incorporated into it.

Along the way, the components were implemented differently from the class code.

## How it works

The APP is meant to show a list of TODOs and Goals from an API and allow the user to delete, toggle and add items. To start it type `yarn start`.

## Learning Goals
* Using Redux from React
* making the redux store available to components via connect
* how to arrange the reducers, middleware, components and actions into separate directories


### Authors
* Udacity React Nanodegree Team
* Eric Njogu (additional components and props)
